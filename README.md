PickUp is a landed social metaverse system based on DID protocol multi-chain deployment. In the PickUp metaverse, the ideas of Gamefi, Socialfi, and NFTFi are integrated and combined in practice through the technology of blockchain to build their own exclusive PickUp social graph.


Users can create their own DIDs in the PickUp metaverse, which represent different values through different DID digits, and thus build their own exclusive social graph network.


PickUp debuts BlockWheels, the first parking space grabbing game in the metaverse, which implants NFT elements in the traditional parking space grabbing model and allows pledging NFT for mining to get actual revenue, turning it from a traditional kryptonite game into a game where you can use your social graph to earn high revenue. And through a reasonable economic model as well as operational strategy to make our PickUp metaverse a real DID practical applicability of social graph.
